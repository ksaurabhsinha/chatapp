# ChatApp

This is my first application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [GO](https://golang.org/) and [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/).

### Development Status

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* Client Part - This is a ReactJs Application (under development)
* Server Part - This is a GoLang Application (to be done later)
* Storage - RethinkDB - the open source real time we db (to be done later)
